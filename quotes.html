<p>&quot;The Master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work
and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his
education and his recreation, his love and his religion.
He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence
in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing.
To him he is always doing both.&quot;
<strong>-- Zen Philosophy</strong></p>
<!-- stop-show-quotes -->
<p>&quot;Most people want to avoid pain, and discipline is usually painful.&quot;
<strong>--John C. Maxwell</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.&quot;
<strong>--Jim Rohn</strong></p>
<p>“Your beliefs become your thoughts, Your thoughts become your words,
Your words become your actions, Your actions become your habits,
Your habits become your values, Your values become your destiny.”
<strong>-- Mahatma Gandhi</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Don't be afraid to fail, be afraid not to try.&quot;
<strong>-- Unknown</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The most dangerous person is one who listens, thinks and observes.&quot;
<strong>-- Bruce Lee</strong></p>
<p>&quot;宝剑锋从磨砺出，梅花香自苦寒来&quot;
<strong>-- 选自 &lt;警世贤文·勤奋篇&gt;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;There are two kinds of gifts. First, there is the innate gift of a given skill.
<em>This is a minor gift.</em> If you have this gift, a skill such as doing math or playing
the piano comes naturally to you. There are millions of people with minor gifts of all
kinds who never do anything great with their gifted skills, because they lack the major
gift.</p>
<p>The <em>major gift is the love of the work.</em> This might seem backward. How can love of
using a skill be more important than the skill itself? It is for this simple reason:
if you have a major gift, you will do things with the skills you have. And keep doing
them. And your love of the work will shine through. And through practice, your skills
will grow and become more powerful, until your skills are as great or greater than
someone who only has the minor gift.</p>
<p>There is only one way to find out if you have the major gift.
<em>Start down the path, and see if it makes your heart sing.</em>&quot;
<strong>-- From &quot;The Art of Game Design&quot;[Schell '08]</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Don't complain - Expect nothing - Do something&quot;
<strong>-- New York Giants football motto</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Maturation as a scientist involves many components, but a <em>key one for me was the development of taste,</em> much as it is in the enjoyment of art, music, food, or wine. One needs to learn what
problems are important. I sensed myself developing taste, distinguishing what was interesting from
what was not - and among the things that were interesting, <em>I also learned what was doable.</em>&quot;
<strong>-- Eric Kandel</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Those who do good science do so because they choose problems that are suited to them.&quot;
<strong>-- Lee Smolin</strong></p>
<p>&quot;You should spend at least as much time in the presentation of the work
as you do in the work itself.&quot;
<strong>-- Hamming (You and Your Research)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Though this be madness yet there is method in it.&quot;
<strong>-- Shakespeare (Hamlet)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Ever try? Ever fail? No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.&quot;
<strong>-- Samuel Beckett</strong></p>
<p>&quot;To teach is to learn twice.&quot;
<strong>-- Joseph Jouberts</strong></p>
<p>&quot;If you're smart, what you do is make connections. To make
connections, you have to have inputs. Thus, try to avoid having
the same exact inputs as everyone else. Gain new experiences and
thus bring together things no one has brought together before.&quot;
<strong>-- Steve Jobs</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise...&quot;
<strong>-- J.R.R. Tolkien</strong></p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to make something that's interesting... Basically, anything that anyone makes...
It's like a law of nature, a law of aerodynamics, that anything that's written or anything
that's created wants to be mediocre. It's all tending toward mediocrity the way that all
the atoms are dissipating out toward the expanse of the universe. Everything wants to be
mediocre, so what it takes to make anything that is more than mediocre is an <em>extreme act of will.</em>
You just have to exert so much will into something for it to be good.&quot;
<strong>-- Ira Glass (This American Life)</strong> (found in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqPSnjewkuA">Graduate School: Keys To Success</a>)</p>
<p>&quot;People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man, I'm flesh and blood, I can be ignored, I can be destroyed; but as a symbol... as a symbol I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.&quot;
<strong>-- Bruce Wayne (Batman Begins)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I came, I saw, I conquered.&quot;
<strong>-- Julius Caesar</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The best way [to be a programmer] is to write programs, and to study great programs that
other people have written.&quot;
<strong>-- Bill Gates</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.&quot;
<strong>-- C. G. JUNG</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself.&quot;
<strong>-- Publilius Syrus</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Not every legend is a myth, some are flesh and blood. Some legends walk among us, but they aren’t born, they’re built. Legends are made from iron &amp; sweat, mind and muscle, blood and vision and victory. Legends are champions, they grow, they win, they conquer. There’s a legend behind every legacy, there’s a blueprint behind every legend.&quot;
<strong>--  Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Look to the master, follow the master, walk with the master, see through the master, become the master.&quot;
<strong>-- Eric S. Raymond</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability.&quot;
-- <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.lang.c++/rYCO5yn4lXw/oITtSkZOtoUJ">John Woods</a></p>
<p>&quot;Every piece of computer software, no matter how small, involves at least a team of two -- me, and me six months from now when I have to fix it.&quot;
-- <a class="reference external" href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/05/09/14/1451238/perl-best-practices">Tony Williams from Slashdot.com</a></p>
<p>&quot;Intelligence without ambition is a bird without wings.&quot;
<strong>-- Salvador Dali</strong></p>
<p>&quot;A boss creates fear, a leader confidence. A boss fixes blame, a leader corrects mistakes. A boss knows all, a leader asks questions. A boss makes work drudgery, a leader makes it interesting. A boss is interested in himself or herself, a leader is interested in the group.&quot;
<strong>-- Russell H Ewing</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I've always lived cheaply. I live like a
student, basically.  And I like that, because it means that money is not
telling me what to do.  I can do what I think is important for me to do.
It freed me to do what seemed worth doing.  So make a real effort to
avoid getting sucked into all the expensive lifestyle habits of typical
Americans.  Because if you do that, then people with the money will
dictate what you do with your life.  You won't be able to do what's really
important to you.&quot;
<strong>-- Richard Stallman</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Effective interview process: interviewing is a two-way process. During the interview,
the interviewee is evaluating the company by the interviewing question quality.
I'd suggest this is one of the most efficient ways to understand your potential coworkers.&quot;

<p>&quot;No such thing as spare time, no such thing as free time, no such thing as down time.
All you got is life time. Go.&quot;
<strong>-- Henry Rollins</strong></p>
<p>&quot;If you want to become a good programmer, you can spend 10 years programming, or spend
2 years programming and learning algorithms.&quot;
<strong>-- Erik Demaine</strong></p>
<p>&quot;To use an analogy, if algorithms were about automobiles, it would be for the person
who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient,
safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. The people who hate algorithms are the ones
who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else.&quot;
<strong>-- Peter Norvig</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate.
The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting
although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated.&quot;
<strong>-- Bill Gates (found in reddit AMA)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Curly braces lead to anger. Anger leads to fear. Fear leads to suffering.&quot;
<strong>-- Kensanata on #emacs</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.&quot;
<strong>-- Albert Einstein</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Talk is cheap. Show me the code.&quot;
<strong>-- Linus Torvalds</strong></p>
<p>&quot;If you would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not let yourselves carried
aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people's backs and heads.&quot;
<strong>-- Nietzsche</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &quot;I know, I'll use regular
expression.&quot; Now they have two problems.&quot;
<strong>-- Jamie Zawinski (found in comp.emacs.xemacs)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Another strategy is to ignore the fact that you are slowly killing yourself by
not sleeping and exercising enough. That frees up several hours a day.
The only downside is that you get fat and die.&quot;
<strong>-- Scott Adams</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Good judgment comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgment.
If things aren't going well it probably means you are learning a lot
and things will go better later.&quot;
<strong>-- Randy Pausch</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it
begin here.&quot;
<strong>-- Captain John Parker</strong></p>
