<p>"On the subject of not having a good/challenging job:
Hogwash. Either get a better job, or here's an idea: Make your current job into something
it's <strong>not</strong>, at least right now.
One of the best programmers I knew walked into a
job as a maintenance programmer on a legacy system that consisted of dozens of programs
and hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Most of which had been hacked on over the years so much that
you would have to say there wasn't any coherent design to it anymore.
This was pretty much a go-nowhere, dead-end job.
Management wanted you to keep your head down, and just fix the damn bugs.
The good developers were working on the greenfield project.
People either came here to sit out their remaining days until they retired,
or gain a few years of experience before going on to new application development.
Whereas most programmers would complain about the lack of career development,
or the opportunity to learn new things, or not having exciting projects to work on,
or more generally just bitching about <strong>no one enabling them</strong>, this guy simply sat down,
and went about doing the work that needed to be done.
And over the course of 2 years, he had transformed that system from a buggy hell of spaghetti
code to something that was a thing of beauty and functioned like a swiss watch.
So complete was the transformation, that the VP of the division started
paying more &amp; more attention to the existing project, and started questioning the value of the greenfield project.
Although he didn't have a title, the operations people went to him as the de-facto leader of the group.
When I left, the VP was talking about creating a new role for him as a systems architect...
I'm not sure what happened to him after that, but he taught me a couple of very important lessons:
1. Your job is what you make it, and there's interesting problems to be solved <strong>everywhere</strong>.
If you hate writing CRUD screens, solve the problem by automatically generating them.
2. Don't sit around waiting for opportunities to come to you. Chances are they never will."

<p>"其实你们看了这个视频水友们 教给你们一个道理 在这个圈子里面 你们可以看到 我是无数次的跌落至谷底。
我跟你们说下我的状况 我的状况就是我爸不在了 我家里根本就没有任何的后援 你们懂吗？ 我给你们教一个人生的道理
当时我家里没有任何的后援 我家里没有任何人能给我提供任何的资源 我想活着 我想有收入 我只能打职业。
但是我在职业经常就遭遇毁灭性的打击-被离队。因为我经常收到各种微信 跟我说他有多惨 龙神你能帮帮我吗？
你们知道当时我有多惨吗？ 我家里没有一个人能给我一分钱 我只能靠打职业来养活自己 我养不活自己我每天就只能吃饭
连收入都没有 我家里是个后妈 她能管我管道哪去。你要想在dota圈这个地方被离队 没有下家没有别的队伍要你 你不去
一个新的队伍打成绩 打出成绩 你在一个什么二线队养老 根本就活不下去号码？ 你们可以看到我跌倒了多少次。
你们不要老哭我被踢 但是你们看一下我 跌倒了多少次 为了人生 我是有做了多大的努力。所以我觉得你们有些水友
天天抱怨自己怎么怎么惨 你拿着这个抱怨的气 你去好好工作好好读书也好 好好学也好 比你在这抱怨有用多了。
其实想想人生就是这样 我觉得很多水友也是有学生 应该也有收入不高 比较基层的水友 大家都是穷怕了的。
像我做主播以前 真的就是穷怕了 生活过的可能比你们都苦 比你们都惨。但是我这么多年 我也是坚持下来了呀
努力呀 所以我还是希望 能激励你们一下 对人生不要放弃。做事情不要不用心 混日子 千万不要混日子 千万不要混吃等死。
对自己的工作你再想玩 再想干什么该做的工作都要做好 希望你们能听我一言 这样的话你们可以说 以后在不同的领域
也会有更好的机遇起飞一下的。 你都要做好准备 虽然说不一定来 但是你做好准备了 你就能抓住 你不做好准备
机会来了 也会离开你。 我就是书读的少呀 文化也不高呀 素质也就这样呀 人嘛也是矮矮的 也不是很帅 坚持呀 运气总会来的。”

<p>"Now I've actually always found something that to be very true which is most
people don't get those experiences because they'd never asked. I've never
found anybody that didn't want to help me if I asked them for help. I always
call him up I called up this will date me but I called up Bill Hewlett when I
was 12 years old and he lived in Palo Alto. His number was still in a phonebook
and he answered the phone himself you know. "yes?" "hi I'm Steve Jobs I'm 12 years
old I'm a student in high school and I want to build a frequency counter and I
was wondering if you had any spare parts I could have?" and he laughed and he gave
me the spare parts to build his frequency counter and he gave me a job
that summer in Hewlett Packard working on the assembly line putting nuts and
bolts together on frequency counters. He got me a job in the place that built him
and I was in heaven and I've never found anyone who said no or hung up the phone
when I call. I just asked and when people ask me I try to be as responsive to pay
that that debt of gratitude back. Most people never pick up the phone and call.
Most people never ask and that's what separates sometimes the people that do
things from the people that just dream about them. You got it. You got to act and
you've got to be willing to fail. You've got to be willing to crash and burn, you
know, with people on the phone, with starting a company, with whatever. If
you're afraid of failing, you won't get very far."

<p>"腾讯副总裁吴军博士说“成功的道路并不像想象得那么拥挤，因为在人生的马拉松长路上，绝大部分人跑不到一半就主动退下来了。
到后来，剩下的少数人不是嫌竞争对手太多，而是发愁怎样找一个同伴陪自己一同跑下去。
因此，教育是一辈子的事情，笑到最后的人是一辈子接受教育的人。回过头来看，一些过去比我们读书更优秀，
在起跑线上抢到了更好位置的人，早已放弃了人生的马拉松，我们能够跑得更远，仅仅是因为我们还在跑，如此而已。”急功近利不好，悲观绝望也不好。”

<p>"据我观察，大多数人会在本科毕业的时候就选择了不努力，少数人在坚持硕士或者博士毕业后开始不努力，更少数人能熬到走到社会上之后第一次成功，
然后在第一次失败的打击之下选择了不努力。极少数在不断失败之后还能起来的人，几乎都成为了我们所熟知的名人。
不瞒你说，我认识的长辈里有不少是90年代天之骄子，一时全城名声大噪风光无两，然而现在。。。选择放弃才是常态，不放弃是极少数。”

We can't grade you on how much of a success you'll be after graduation,
how smart/creative/persistent/self-motivated you are, or even how well you'll be able to apply the material in the future.

<p>"There are two kinds of gifts. First, there is the innate gift of a given skill.
<em>This is a minor gift.</em> If you have this gift, a skill such as doing math or playing
the piano comes naturally to you. There are millions of people with minor gifts of all
kinds who never do anything great with their gifted skills, because they lack the major
gift.</p>
<p>The <em>major gift is the love of the work.</em> This might seem backward. How can love of
using a skill be more important than the skill itself? It is for this simple reason:
if you have a major gift, you will do things with the skills you have. And keep doing
them. And your love of the work will shine through. And through practice, your skills
will grow and become more powerful, until your skills are as great or greater than
someone who only has the minor gift.</p>
<p>There is only one way to find out if you have the major gift.
<em>Start down the path, and see if it makes your heart sing.</em>"

<p>"Maturation as a scientist involves many components, but a <em>key one for me was the development of taste,</em> much as it is in the enjoyment of art, music, food, or wine. One needs to learn what

what was not - and among the things that were interesting, <em>I also learned what was doable.</em>"

<p>"It's hard to make something that's interesting... Basically, anything that anyone makes...
It's like a law of nature, a law of aerodynamics, that anything that's written or anything

the atoms are dissipating out toward the expanse of the universe. Everything wants to be
mediocre, so what it takes to make anything that is more than mediocre is an <em>extreme act of will.</em>
