<p>"I don't have any magical ability. ... When I was a kid, I had a romanticized notion of mathematics,
that hard problems were solved in 'Eureka' moments of inspiration. [But] with me, it's always, '
Let's try this. That gets me part of the way, or that doesn't work. Now let's try this. Oh, there's
a little shortcut here.' You work on it long enough and you happen to make progress towards a hard
problem by a back door at some point. At the end, it's usally, 'Oh, I've solved the problem.'"

<p>"I have spent my whole life scared - frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen. Fifty years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at three in the morning. But you know what? Ever since my diagnosis, I sleep just fine.
What I came to realize is that fear, that's the worst of it. That's the real enemy.
So, get up, get out in the real world and you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth."
<strong>-- Walter White</strong> ("Breaking Bad" Season 2 Episode 8 "Better Call Saul")</p>
<p>"I used to be a beat cop, long time ago. And I'd get called out on domestic disputes all the time, hundreds probably over the years.
But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit, that I will never forget: Gordy. [...]</p>
<p>Big Boy; 270, 280. But his wife, or whatever
she was, his lady, was real small. Like a bird, wrists like little branches. Anyway, my partner and I get called out there
every weekend and one of us would pull here aside and say, "C'mon, tonight's the night we press charges." And this wasn't one of
those 'deep down he really loves me' setups, we got a lot of those, but not this. This girl was scared. She wasn't gonna cross him no way, no how.
Nothing we could do but pass her off to the EMTs, put him in the car, drive him downtown, throw him in the drunk tank. He sleeps it off, next
morning out he goes, back home. But one night, my partner's out sick and it's just me. And the call comes in and it's the usual crap.
Broke her nose in the shower kind of thing. So I cuff him, put him in the car and away we go. Only that night, we're driving into town,
and this sideways asshole is in my backseat humming 'Danny Boy'. And it just rubbed me wrong. So instead of left, I go right, out into nowhere.
And I kneel him down and I put my revolver in his mouth and I told him, "This is it. This is how it ends." And he's crying, going to the
bathroom all over himself, swearing to God he's gonna leave her alone, screaming - much as you can with a gun in your mouth. And I
told him to be quiet, that I needed to think about what I was gonna do here. And of course he got quiet. Goes still, and real quiet,
like a dog waiting for dinner scraps. And we just stood there for a while: me acting like I'm thinking things over, and Prince Charming
kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants. After a few minutes I took the gun out of his mouth and I say: "So help me if you ever touch
her again I will such and such and such and blah blah blah blah blah. [...]</p>
<p>But two weaks later he killed her. Of course. Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender. We got there, there
was so much blood you could taste the metal. The moral of the story is, I chose a half measure when I should have gone all the way.
I'll never make that mistake again. No more half measures, Walter."

<p>"I have missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. On 26 occasions I have been entrusted to take the game

并从他们自己的角度把一些消极的字眼扣在坚持、努力之上，试图把你拉到她们一样的水平。

你没有天赋、你减不下去、你增不了肌、你在浪费时间、你在做表面功夫、这有什么用、没什么意义……

<p>"On the subject of not having a good/challenging job:
Hogwash. Either get a better job, or here's an idea: Make your current job into something
it's <strong>not</strong>, at least right now.
One of the best programmers I knew walked into a
job as a maintenance programmer on a legacy system that consisted of dozens of programs
and hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Most of which had been hacked on over the years so much that
you would have to say there wasn't any coherent design to it anymore.
This was pretty much a go-nowhere, dead-end job.
Management wanted you to keep your head down, and just fix the damn bugs.
The good developers were working on the greenfield project.
People either came here to sit out their remaining days until they retired,
or gain a few years of experience before going on to new application development.
Whereas most programmers would complain about the lack of career development,
or the opportunity to learn new things, or not having exciting projects to work on,
or more generally just bitching about <strong>no one enabling them</strong>, this guy simply sat down,
and went about doing the work that needed to be done.
And over the course of 2 years, he had transformed that system from a buggy hell of spaghetti
code to something that was a thing of beauty and functioned like a swiss watch.
So complete was the transformation, that the VP of the division started
paying more &amp; more attention to the existing project, and started questioning the value of the greenfield project.
Although he didn't have a title, the operations people went to him as the de-facto leader of the group.
When I left, the VP was talking about creating a new role for him as a systems architect...
I'm not sure what happened to him after that, but he taught me a couple of very important lessons:
1. Your job is what you make it, and there's interesting problems to be solved <strong>everywhere</strong>.
If you hate writing CRUD screens, solve the problem by automatically generating them.
2. Don't sit around waiting for opportunities to come to you. Chances are they never will."

<p>"其实你们看了这个视频水友们 教给你们一个道理 在这个圈子里面 你们可以看到 我是无数次的跌落至谷底。
我跟你们说下我的状况 我的状况就是我爸不在了 我家里根本就没有任何的后援 你们懂吗？ 我给你们教一个人生的道理
当时我家里没有任何的后援 我家里没有任何人能给我提供任何的资源 我想活着 我想有收入 我只能打职业。
但是我在职业经常就遭遇毁灭性的打击-被离队。因为我经常收到各种微信 跟我说他有多惨 龙神你能帮帮我吗？
你们知道当时我有多惨吗？ 我家里没有一个人能给我一分钱 我只能靠打职业来养活自己 我养不活自己我每天就只能吃饭
连收入都没有 我家里是个后妈 她能管我管道哪去。你要想在dota圈这个地方被离队 没有下家没有别的队伍要你 你不去
一个新的队伍打成绩 打出成绩 你在一个什么二线队养老 根本就活不下去好吗？ 你们可以看到我跌倒了多少次。
你们不要老哭我被踢 但是你们看一下我 跌倒了多少次 为了人生 我是有做了多大的努力。所以我觉得你们有些水友
天天抱怨自己怎么怎么惨 你拿着这个抱怨的气 你去好好工作好好读书也好 好好学也好 比你在这抱怨有用多了。
其实想想人生就是这样 我觉得很多水友也是有学生 应该也有收入不高 比较基层的水友 大家都是穷怕了的。
像我做主播以前 真的就是穷怕了 生活过的可能比你们都苦 比你们都惨。但是我这么多年 我也是坚持下来了呀
努力呀 所以我还是希望 能激励你们一下 对人生不要放弃。做事情不要不用心 混日子 千万不要混日子 千万不要混吃等死。
对自己的工作你再想玩 再想干什么该做的工作都要做好 希望你们能听我一言 这样的话你们可以说 以后在不同的领域
也会有更好的机遇起飞一下的。 你都要做好准备 虽然说不一定来 但是你做好准备了 你就能抓住 你不做好准备
机会来了 也会离开你。 我就是书读的少呀 文化也不高呀 素质也就这样呀 人嘛也是矮矮的 也不是很帅 坚持呀 运气总会来的。”

<p>"Now I've actually always found something that to be very true which is most
people don't get those experiences because they'd never asked. I've never
found anybody that didn't want to help me if I asked them for help. I always
call him up I called up this will date me but I called up Bill Hewlett when I
was 12 years old and he lived in Palo Alto. His number was still in a phonebook
and he answered the phone himself you know. "yes?" "hi I'm Steve Jobs I'm 12 years
old I'm a student in high school and I want to build a frequency counter and I
was wondering if you had any spare parts I could have?" and he laughed and he gave
me the spare parts to build his frequency counter and he gave me a job
that summer in Hewlett Packard working on the assembly line putting nuts and
bolts together on frequency counters. He got me a job in the place that built him
and I was in heaven and I've never found anyone who said no or hung up the phone
when I call. I just asked and when people ask me I try to be as responsive to pay
that that debt of gratitude back. Most people never pick up the phone and call.
Most people never ask and that's what separates sometimes the people that do
things from the people that just dream about them. You got it. You got to act and
you've got to be willing to fail. You've got to be willing to crash and burn, you
know, with people on the phone, with starting a company, with whatever. If
you're afraid of failing, you won't get very far."

<p>"腾讯副总裁吴军博士说“成功的道路并不像想象得那么拥挤，因为在人生的马拉松长路上，绝大部分人跑不到一半就主动退下来了。
到后来，剩下的少数人不是嫌竞争对手太多，而是发愁怎样找一个同伴陪自己一同跑下去。
因此，教育是一辈子的事情，笑到最后的人是一辈子接受教育的人。回过头来看，一些过去比我们读书更优秀，
在起跑线上抢到了更好位置的人，早已放弃了人生的马拉松，我们能够跑得更远，仅仅是因为我们还在跑，如此而已。”急功近利不好，悲观绝望也不好。”

<p>"Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people do that,
but the really great make you feel that you too, can be great."
<strong>-- Mark Twain</strong></p>
<p>"Your code is like your boyfriend or girlfriend.
It's okay to talk about it on an abstract, high level.
But you don't want to go into the specific details, and you certainly don't want to share."
<strong>-- Pascal Van Hentenryck</strong></p>
<p>"It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer."
<strong>--Albert Einstein</strong></p>
<p>"Most people want to avoid pain, and discipline is usually painful."
<strong>--John C. Maxwell</strong></p>
<p>"Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment."
<strong>--Jim Rohn</strong></p>

Your habits become your values, Your values become your destiny.”

<strong>-- Unknown</strong></p>

<p>"宝剑锋从磨砺出，梅花香自苦寒来"
<strong>-- 选自 &lt;警世贤文·勤奋篇&gt;</strong></p>
<p>"There are two kinds of gifts. First, there is the innate gift of a given skill.
<em>This is a minor gift.</em> If you have this gift, a skill such as doing math or playing
the piano comes naturally to you. There are millions of people with minor gifts of all
kinds who never do anything great with their gifted skills, because they lack the major
gift.</p>
<p>The <em>major gift is the love of the work.</em> This might seem backward. How can love of
using a skill be more important than the skill itself? It is for this simple reason:
if you have a major gift, you will do things with the skills you have. And keep doing
them. And your love of the work will shine through. And through practice, your skills
will grow and become more powerful, until your skills are as great or greater than
someone who only has the minor gift.</p>
<p>There is only one way to find out if you have the major gift.
<em>Start down the path, and see if it makes your heart sing.</em>"
<strong>-- "The Art of Game Design"</strong></p>
<p>"Don't complain - Expect nothing - Do something"
<strong>-- New York Giants football motto</strong></p>
<p>"Maturation as a scientist involves many components, but a <em>key one for me was the development of taste,</em> much as it is in the enjoyment of art, music, food, or wine. One needs to learn what
problems are important. I sensed myself developing taste, distinguishing what was interesting from
what was not - and among the things that were interesting, <em>I also learned what was doable.</em>"
<strong>-- Eric Kandel</strong></p>
<p>"Those who do good science do so because they choose problems that are suited to them."
<strong>-- Lee Smolin</strong></p>
<p>"You should spend at least as much time in the presentation of the work
as you do in the work itself."
<strong>-- Hamming (You and Your Research)</strong></p>
<p>"Though this be madness yet there is method in it."
<strong>-- Shakespeare (Hamlet)</strong></p>
<p>"Ever try? Ever fail? No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better."
<strong>-- Samuel Beckett</strong></p>
<p>"To teach is to learn twice."
<strong>-- Joseph Jouberts</strong></p>
<p>"If you're smart, what you do is make connections. To make
connections, you have to have inputs. Thus, try to avoid having
the same exact inputs as everyone else. Gain new experiences and
thus bring together things no one has brought together before."
<strong>-- Steve Jobs</strong></p>
<p>"Advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise..."
<strong>-- J.R.R. Tolkien</strong></p>
<p>"It's hard to make something that's interesting... Basically, anything that anyone makes...
It's like a law of nature, a law of aerodynamics, that anything that's written or anything
that's created wants to be mediocre. It's all tending toward mediocrity the way that all
the atoms are dissipating out toward the expanse of the universe. Everything wants to be
mediocre, so what it takes to make anything that is more than mediocre is an <em>extreme act of will.</em>
You just have to exert so much will into something for it to be good."
<strong>-- Ira Glass (This American Life)</strong> (found in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqPSnjewkuA">Graduate School: Keys To Success</a>)</p>
<p>"People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man, I'm flesh and blood, I can be ignored, I can be destroyed; but as a symbol... as a symbol I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting."
<strong>-- Bruce Wayne (Batman Begins)</strong></p>
<p>"I came, I saw, I conquered."
<strong>-- Julius Caesar</strong></p>
<p>"The best way [to be a programmer] is to write programs, and to study great programs that
other people have written."
<strong>-- Bill Gates</strong></p>
<p>"The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed."
<strong>-- C. G. JUNG</strong></p>
<p>"Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself."
<strong>-- Publilius Syrus</strong></p>
<p>"Not every legend is a myth, some are flesh and blood. Some legends walk among us, but they aren’t born, they’re built. Legends are made from iron &amp; sweat, mind and muscle, blood and vision and victory. Legends are champions, they grow, they win, they conquer. There’s a legend behind every legacy, there’s a blueprint behind every legend."
<strong>--  Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong></p>
<p>"Look to the master, follow the master, walk with the master, see through the master, become the master."
<strong>-- Eric S. Raymond</strong></p>

<p>"Every piece of computer software, no matter how small, involves at least a team of two -- me, and me six months from now when I have to fix it."

<p>"Intelligence without ambition is a bird without wings."
<strong>-- Salvador Dali</strong></p>
<p>"A boss creates fear, a leader confidence. A boss fixes blame, a leader corrects mistakes. A boss knows all, a leader asks questions. A boss makes work drudgery, a leader makes it interesting. A boss is interested in himself or herself, a leader is interested in the group."
<strong>-- Russell H Ewing</strong></p>
<p>"I've always lived cheaply. I live like a
student, basically.  And I like that, because it means that money is not
telling me what to do.  I can do what I think is important for me to do.
It freed me to do what seemed worth doing.  So make a real effort to
avoid getting sucked into all the expensive lifestyle habits of typical
Americans.  Because if you do that, then people with the money will
dictate what you do with your life.  You won't be able to do what's really
important to you."
<strong>-- Richard Stallman</strong></p>
<p>"Effective interview process: interviewing is a two-way process. During the interview,
the interviewee is evaluating the company by the interviewing question quality.
I'd suggest this is one of the most efficient ways to understand your potential coworkers."

<p>"No such thing as spare time, no such thing as free time, no such thing as down time.
All you got is life time. Go."
<strong>-- Henry Rollins</strong></p>
<p>"If you want to become a good programmer, you can spend 10 years programming, or spend
2 years programming and learning algorithms."
<strong>-- Erik Demaine</strong></p>
<p>"To use an analogy, if algorithms were about automobiles, it would be for the person
who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient,
safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. The people who hate algorithms are the ones
who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else."
<strong>-- Peter Norvig</strong></p>
<p>"I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate.
The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting
although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated."
<strong>-- Bill Gates (found in reddit AMA)</strong></p>
<p>"Curly braces lead to anger. Anger leads to fear. Fear leads to suffering."
<strong>-- Kensanata on #emacs</strong></p>
<p>"The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources."
<strong>-- Albert Einstein</strong></p>
<p>"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."
<strong>-- Linus Torvalds</strong></p>
<p>"If you would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not let yourselves carried
aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people's backs and heads."
<strong>-- Nietzsche</strong></p>
<p>"Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular
expression." Now they have two problems."
<strong>-- Jamie Zawinski (found in comp.emacs.xemacs)</strong></p>
<p>"Another strategy is to ignore the fact that you are slowly killing yourself by
not sleeping and exercising enough. That frees up several hours a day.
The only downside is that you get fat and die."
<strong>-- Scott Adams</strong></p>
<p>"Good judgment comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgment.
If things aren't going well it probably means you are learning a lot
and things will go better later."
<strong>-- Randy Pausch</strong></p>
<p>"Don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it
begin here."
<strong>-- Captain John Parker</strong></p>
