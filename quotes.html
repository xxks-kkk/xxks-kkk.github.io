<p>&#8220;The Master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work
and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his
education and his recreation, his love and his religion.
He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence
in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing.
To him he is always doing both.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Zen Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Not every legend is a myth, some are flesh and blood. Some legends walk among us, but they aren’t born, they’re built. Legends are made from iron &amp; sweat, mind and muscle, blood and vision and victory. Legends are champions, they grow, they win, they conquer. There’s a legend behind every legacy, there’s a blueprint behind every legend.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211;  Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Look to the master, follow the master, walk with the master, see through the master, become the master.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Eric S. Raymond</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;Every piece of computer software, no matter how small, involves at least a team of two &#8211; me, and me six months from now when I have to fix it.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;Intelligence without ambition is a bird without wings.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Salvador Dali</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;A boss creates fear, a leader confidence. A boss fixes blame, a leader corrects mistakes. A boss knows all, a leader asks questions. A boss makes work drudgery, a leader makes it interesting. A boss is interested in himself or herself, a leader is interested in the group.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always lived cheaply. I live like a
student, basically.  And I like that, because it means that money is not
telling me what to do.  I can do what I think is important for me to do.
It freed me to do what seemed worth doing.  So make a real effort to
avoid getting sucked into all the expensive lifestyle habits of typical
Americans.  Because if you do that, then people with the money will
dictate what you do with your life.  You won&#8217;t be able to do what&#8217;s really
important to you.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;Effective interview process: interviewing is a two-way process. During the interview,
the interviewee is evaluating the company by the interviewing question quality.
I&#8217;d suggest this is one of the most efficient ways to understand your potential coworkers.
I felt that questions I got from Quora were interesting and challenging and gave me confidence that their selection process will choose good people.
I was also impressed by my interviewers.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;No such thing as spare time, no such thing as free time, no such thing as down time.
All you got is life time. Go.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Henry Rollins</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to become a good programmer, you can spend 10 years programming, or spend
2 years programming and learning algorithms.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Erik Demaine</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;To use an analogy, if algorithms were about automobiles, it would be for the person
who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient,
safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. The people who hate algorithms are the ones
who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Peter Norvig</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate.
The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting
although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Bill Gates (found in reddit AMA)</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Curly braces lead to anger. Anger leads to fear. Fear leads to suffering.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Albert Einstein</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Talk is cheap. Show me the code.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Linus Torvalds</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;If you would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not let yourselves carried
aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people&#8217;s backs and heads.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Nietzsche</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &#8220;I know, I&#8217;ll use regular
expression.&#8221; Now they have two problems.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Jamie Zawinski (found in comp.emacs.xemacs)</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Another strategy is to ignore the fact that you are slowly killing yourself by
not sleeping and exercising enough. That frees up several hours a day.
The only downside is that you get fat and die.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Scott Adams</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Good judgment comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgment.
If things aren&#8217;t going well it probably means you are learning a lot
and things will go better later.&#8221;
<strong>&#8211; Randy Pausch</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it
begin here.&#8221;
