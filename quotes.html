<p>&#8220;The Master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work
and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his
education and his recreation, his love and his religion.
He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence
in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing.
To him he is always doing both.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Zen Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to become a good programmer, you can spend 10 years programming, or spend
2 years programming and learning algorithms.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Erik Demaine</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;To use an analogy, if algorithms were about automobiles, it would be for the person
who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient,
safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. The people who hate algorithms are the ones
who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Peter Norvig</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate.
The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting
although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Bill Gates (found in reddit AMA)</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Curly braces lead to anger. Anger leads to fear. Fear leads to suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Kensanata on #emacs</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Albert Einstein</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Talk is cheap. Show me the code.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Linus Torvalds</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;If you would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not let yourselves carried
aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people&#8217;s backs and heads.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Nietzsche</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &#8220;I know, I&#8217;ll use regular
expression.&#8221; Now they have two problems.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Jamie Zawinski (found in comp.emacs.xemacs)</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Another strategy is to ignore the fact that you are slowly killing yourself by
not sleeping and exercising enough. That frees up several hours a day.
The only downside is that you get fat and die.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Scott Adams</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Good judgment comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgment.
If things aren&#8217;t going well it probably means you are learning a lot
and things will go better later.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Randy Pausch</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it
begin here.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Captain John Parker</strong></p>
