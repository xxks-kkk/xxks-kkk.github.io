<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this post, we breifly summarize the basic concepts related to graph algorithm. Then, we study topological sort to make
the graph concepts into practice.</p>
<h2 id="graph-basics">Graph Basics</h2>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>graph</strong> <span class="math">\(G = (V,E)\)</span> consists of a set of <strong>vertices</strong> <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, and a set of <strong>edges</strong> <span class="math">\(E\)</span>.</li>
<li>Each edge (i.e., <strong>arcs</strong>) is a pair <span class="math">\((v,w)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(v,w \in V\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given an edge <span class="math">\(e = (u,v)\)</span>, the vertex <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is its <strong>source</strong>, and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is its <strong>sink</strong>.</li>
<li>If the pair is ordered, then the graph is <strong>directed</strong> (i.e., <strong>digraphs</strong>).</li>
<li>Vertex <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is <strong>adjacent</strong> to <span class="math">\(v\)</span> iff <span class="math">\((v,w) \in E\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In digraph, <span class="math">\((v,w)\)</span> is not the same as <span class="math">\((w,v)\)</span>. Thus, if <span class="math">\((v,w) \in E\)</span> and <span class="math">\((w,v) \not\in E\)</span>, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is
adjacent to <span class="math">\(w\)</span> but <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is NOT adjacent to <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. However, for the undirected graph, if <span class="math">\((v,w) \in E\)</span>, then
<span class="math">\((w,v) \in E\)</span>. Thus, if <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is adjacent to <span class="math">\(w\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is adjacent to <span class="math">\(v\)</span> in undirected graph.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>path</strong> in a graph is a sequence of vertices <span class="math">\(w_1, w_2, w_3, \dots, w_N\)</span> such that <span class="math">\((w_i, w_{i+1}) \in E\)</span> for
<span class="math">\(1 \le i &lt; N\)</span>. The <strong>length</strong> of such path is the number of edges on the path, which is equal to <span class="math">\(N - 1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<ul>
<li>We allow a path from a vertex to itself<ul>
<li>If this path contains no edge, then the path length is 0</li>
<li>If the graph contains an edge <span class="math">\((v,v)\)</span> from a vertex to itself, then the path <span class="math">\(v,v\)</span> is referred to as a <strong>loop</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>simple path</strong> is a path such that all vertices are distinct, except that the first and last could be the same.</li>
<li>If there is a path from <span class="math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="math">\(v\)</span>, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is said to be <strong>reachable</strong> from <span class="math">\(u\)</span>.</li>
<li>A <strong>cycle</strong> in a graph:<ul>
<li>For directed graph, a cycle is a path of length at least 1 such that vertices <span class="math">\(w_1 = w_N\)</span>.</li>
<li>For undirected graph, we require edges to be distinct<ul>
<li>reasoning: the path <span class="math">\(u,v,u\)</span> in an undirected graph should not be considered a cycle because <span class="math">\((u,v)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((v,u)\)</span>
are the same edge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>directed acyclic graph (DAG)</strong> is a directed graph in which there are no cycles (i.e., paths which contain one or
more edges and which begin and end at the same vertex)<ul>
<li>Vertices in a DAG which have no incoming edges are referred to as <strong>sources</strong></li>
<li>Vertices which have no outgoing edges are referred to as <strong>sinks</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>connected</strong>:<ul>
<li>An undirected graph is <strong>connected</strong> if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex.</li>
<li>A directed graph is <strong>connected</strong> if it contains a directed path from <span class="math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="math">\(v\)</span> or a directed path
from <span class="math">\(v\)</span> to <span class="math">\(u\)</span> for every pair of vertices <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A directed graph is <strong>strongly connected</strong> if it contains a directed path from <span class="math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="math">\(v\)</span> and a directed
path from <span class="math">\(v\)</span> to <span class="math">\(u\)</span> for every pair of vertices <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>.</li>
<li>If a directed graph is not strongly connected, but the underlying graph (without direction to the arcs)
is connected, then the graph is said to be <strong>weakly connected</strong>.</li>
<li>For a graph <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, a <strong>connected component</strong> is a maximal set of vertices <span class="math">\(C\)</span> such that each pair of vertices in <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is connected
in <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. Every vertex belongs to exactly one connected component.</li>
<li>A <strong>complete graph</strong> is a graph in which there is an edge between every pair of vertices.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A tree is a special sort of graph - it is an undirected graph that is connected but has no cycles.
Given a graph <span class="math">\(G = (V, E)\)</span>, if the graph <span class="math">\(G' = (V, E')\)</span> where <span class="math">\(E' \in E\)</span>, is a tree, then <span class="math">\(G'\)</span> is
referred to as a spanning tree of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indegree</strong> of a vertex <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is the number of edges <span class="math">\((u,v)\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Outdegree</strong> of a vertex <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is the number of edges <span class="math">\((v,u)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="representation">Representation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adjacency matrix: use a <span class="math">\(|V| \times |V|\)</span> matrix indexed by vertices, with a <code>1</code> indicating the presence of an edge (i.e.
For each edge <span class="math">\((u, v)\)</span>, we set <code>A[u][v]</code> to <code>true</code>; otherwise the entry in the array is <code>false</code>). If the edge has a weight 
associated with it, then we can set <code>A[u][v]</code> equal to the weight and use either a very large or 
a very small weight as a sentinel to indicate nonexistent edges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disadvantage: we require graph to be dense: <span class="math">\(|E| = \Theta(|V|^2)\)</span>, which is very unlikely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjacency list: For each vertex, we keep a list of all adjacent vertices. For undirected graph, each edge <span class="math">\((u,v)\)</span> appears in
two lists</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantage: only requires <span class="math">\(O(|E|+|V|)\)</span> space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edge Lists: we represent the graph as an array of <span class="math">\(|E|\)</span> edges. For example, for an undirected edge connects <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, we can 
represent it as <code>[0,1]</code>.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="topological-sort">Topological Sort</h2>
<h3 id="definition-and-properties">Definition and Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have following two equivalent definitions:<ul>
<li>Def 1: A topological sort is an ordering of vertices in a DAG such that
if there is a path from <span class="math">\(v_i\)</span> to <span class="math">\(v_j\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(v_j\)</span> appears
after <span class="math">\(v_i\)</span> in the ordering.</li>
<li>Def 2: A topological ordering of a DAG <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a labeling <span class="math">\(f\)</span> of 
<span class="math">\(G\)</span>'s nodes such that:<ul>
<li>The <span class="math">\(f(v)\)</span>'s are the set <span class="math">\({1,2, \dots, n}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\((u,v) \in G \implies f(u) &lt; f(v)\)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="topological sorting example" class="img-responsive" src="/images/topological-sort-example.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Application: sequence tasks while respecting all precedence constraints.
(e.g. course prerequisite structure can be represented as a graph. A topological ordering of these courses is any course sequence that does not violate the prerequisite requirement.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If G has a cycle, there is no topological sort: since for two vertices <span class="math">\(v\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w\)</span> on the cycle, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> precedes <span class="math">\(w\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w\)</span> precedes <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. On ther other hand,
if there is no directed cycle in the graph, we can compute topological sort in linear time (<span class="math">\(O(|V|+|E|)\)</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topological sorting is not necessary unique as shown in the picture above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dfs-approach">DFS Approach</h3>
<p>The basic idea of computing the topological ordering is following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let <span class="math">\(v\)</span> be a sink vertex of <span class="math">\(G\)</span></li>
<li>set <span class="math">\(f(v) = n\)</span></li>
<li>recurse on <span class="math">\(G - {v}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some proofs we need to show for the correctness of the procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every directed acyclic graph has a sink vertex</p>
<p>Suppose the DAG doesn't have a sink vertex, that means every single vertex has at least one outgoing arc. We can start with arbitrary
vertex and follow its outgoing arc to the next vertex. Since there is no sink vertex in our graph, we can repeatedly follow the outgoing
arc of the vertex. Suppose there are <span class="math">\(N\)</span> nodes in the graph and by following edges for <span class="math">\(N\)</span> times, we reach the <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span>th vertex. Since among
the <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> nodes, there are only <span class="math">\(N\)</span> distinct nodes. By the pigeonhole principle, we must have visted some vertex twice. By following the
nodes and visited some node twice, we show that the graph contains a directed cycle, which is a contradiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During each recursion step, we can find a sink vertex</p>
<p>For a DAG, if we delete one or some of the vertices, we still have DAG (i.e., we cannot create a directed cycle). Thus,
in each recursion step, we always have DAG. Then, by the previous observation, during each recursion step, we can find a sink vertex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The above steps do produce topological ordering</p>
<p>By topological ordering, we know that all the edges have to go forward. Intutively, we always want to assign the sink vertex
of the graph to the final position because otherwise there is going to be an outgoing arc of the node and the node that the
outgoing arc points to will be assigned a lower position, which violates the topological ordering (i.e. edge goes backward). 
In our procedure, when a node <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is assigned to position <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, that means we only have <span class="math">\(i\)</span> nodes remaining and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is the sink vertex. 
This implies that all of outgoing arcs and the corresponding nodes are deleted and assigned higher positions. So for every vertex, 
by the time it actually gets assigned a position, it's a sink and it only has incoming arcs from the as yet unsigned vertices. 
It's outgoing arcs all go forward to vertices that were already assigned higher positions, and got deleted previously from the graph. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To implement the procedure above, we use the DFS:</p>
<p><img alt="DFS for topological sort" class="img-responsive" src="/images/topological-dfs.png"/></p>
<p>There are several points we need to note here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We set <span class="math">\(f(s) = \text{current_label}\)</span> right before we about to pop the call stack. At that point, for every edge <span class="math">\((s,v)\)</span>, there is no such
<span class="math">\(v\)</span> that we haven't explored. That means there are no outgoing edges, which indicate that <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is a sink and thus we can assign it a labeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running time: <span class="math">\(O(|E|+|V|)\)</span> (we only visit each vertex in the graph once and we look at each edge once as well)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correctness: we want to show that this DFS algorithm can correctly produce topological ordering. Topological ordering requires that for
an edge <span class="math">\((s,v)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f(s) &lt; f(v)\)</span>. There are two possible cases for DFS: 1) <span class="math">\(s\)</span> get visited first 2) <span class="math">\(v\)</span> get visited first. For the first case,
since there is an edge from <span class="math">\(s\)</span> to <span class="math">\(v\)</span>, DFS will recursively call on <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. In other words, DFS call on <span class="math">\(v\)</span> will finish before the DFS call on <span class="math">\(s\)</span>.
Thus, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> will get a label larger than <span class="math">\(s\)</span> and the topological ordering is satisfied. For the second case, since there is no cycle in DAG, <span class="math">\(s\)</span> will
not get discovered. Thus, <span class="math">\(s\)</span> will be visited later than <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. By the same reasoning as the first case, we still have the topological ordering.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bfs-approach">BFS Approach</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, we can find topological ordering of a graph using BFS as well. Instead of finding the sink vertex each time (i.e. the vertex
with outdegree = 0), we find the source vertex (i.e. the vertex with indegree = 0) each time in BFS. The basic steps to compute the topological ordering follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let <span class="math">\(s\)</span> be a source vertex of <span class="math">\(G\)</span></li>
<li>set <span class="math">\(f(s) = 1\)</span></li>
<li>recurse on <span class="math">\(G - {s}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We omit the proofs of the properties in BFS as the proofs will mirror with the ones for DFS. We can use the BFS to implement the procedure above:</p>
<p><img alt="DFS for topological sort" class="img-responsive" src="/images/topological-bfs.png"/></p>
<p>There are several points we need to note here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the basic version, we pick a source vertex of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> each time and assign the label. Inevitably, we will compute all the indegree of all nodes in
the graph to find the source vertices. However, not all nodes' indegrees will be updated. To save this duplicate calculation, we use a queue (box).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running time: <span class="math">\(O(|E|+|V|)\)</span> (We visit each edge once and for each node, we visit twice: compute the inital indegree; assign the labeling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correctness: this BFS will prodcue the topological ordering because for an edge <span class="math">\((s,v)\)</span>, we will always visit <span class="math">\(s\)</span> before visiting <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. Without
removing <span class="math">\(s\)</span> first, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> will always have an incoming edge, which will not make <span class="math">\(v\)</span> a source vertex. Since we assign the labeling in the increasing order,
<span class="math">\(f(s) &lt; f(v)\)</span>. Thus, we produce a topological ordering.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As one can see the difference between DFS and BFS is that: for DFS, we start with the sink vertex and assign the label of the vertices in the decreasing
order (i.e. start from <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and until <span class="math">\(1\)</span>). However, for BFS, we start with the source vertex and assign the label of the vertices in the increasing fashion
(i.e. start from <span class="math">\(1\)</span> and until <span class="math">\(n\)</span>).</p>
