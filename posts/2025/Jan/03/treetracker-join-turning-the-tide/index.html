or remarks about each paper he is an author <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I think it's a very
nice idea to document the experience on research like that. So, to
follow his footprints, this is the very first post on a piece of
research that I spent five years on. I plan to write a post like this
whenever a piece of research comes to a closure.</p>

<h1 id="background-on-research-aka-stories">Background on Research aka. Stories</h1>
<p>The research is about designing a new join algorithm called <strong>TreeTracker Join
(TTJ)</strong> [<a href='#hu2024treetrackerjointurningtide' id='ref-hu2024treetrackerjointurningtide-1'>Hu et al., 2024</a>] that is fast both in
theory and in practice. The research starts on 10/31/2019. At that time, I was laid off from
my gig at State Street and I reached out to <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~miranker/">Daniel
Miranker</a>, who I TAed for two
years at UT-Austin when I was a master student,  to see if he had any leads for jobs. During the
initial conversations, I talked about my interests in research and
some work I did with DB2 at IBM. He pitched me his vision on
building a next-generation graph database, which required a mixture of
theory and system development. Dancing between theory and practice is
something that I have a strong interest in and I decided to do a PhD
with him.</p>
<!-- I felt very intrigued by the vision and -->
<!-- wanted to do a PhD with him. -->
<p>He gave me two papers: the <strong>full reducer</strong> paper
[<a href='#Bernstein81usingsemi-joins' id='ref-Bernstein81usingsemi-joins-1'>Bernstein and Chiu, 1981</a>] and the <strong>TreeTracker</strong> paper
[<a href='#bayardo1994optimal' id='ref-bayardo1994optimal-1'>BayardoJr and Miranker, 1994</a>], where <a href="https://bayardo.org/">Roberto
Bayardo</a> and Miranker gave an alternative optimal algorithm
for solving a class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">constraint satisfaction problem
(CSP)</a>
that is acyclic. The key difference between TreeTracker and the
piror art
<a href="http://cse.unl.edu/~choueiry/Documents/Mohr+Henderson-AIJ1986.pdf">AC-4</a>
is that AC-4 needs to pre-process CSP so that the resulting
CSP can be solved efficiently (technical term on this is "without
backtracking"). An obvious issue with any pre-processing-based
algorithm is that if the input instance to the algorithm is not
that bad meaning solving the problem directly can lead to the solution
much quicker than the pre-processing itself, pre-processing is
an overhead even though the final runtime bound is
optimal. TreeTracker algorithm directly solves the CSP and perform
extra steps only when it encounter failures during the solving process.</p>
<p>It is well-known that evaluating queries involving join is effectively
the same as solving CSP [<a href='#Kolaitis1998' id='ref-Kolaitis1998-1'>Kolaitis and Vardi, 1998</a>, <a href='#Chandra1977' id='ref-Chandra1977-1'>Chandra and Merlin, 1977</a>]. The full reducer invented
by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/philbe/">Phil
Bernstein</a>
and <a href="https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/Chiu-Dah-Ming-Winston/">Dah-Ming
W. Chiu</a> is
effectively the same as enforcing arc-consistency
[<a href='#russell2016artificial' id='ref-russell2016artificial-1'>Russell and Norvig, 2010</a> Chapter 6] in a CSP that is acyclic. Thus,
any algorithm that is based on the full reducer will have some overhead
just like AC-4. This implies that such algorithm has room for
improvements using the TreeTracker idea; just like what it did for
AC-4. Therefore, Miranker's idea is to translate TreeTracker from CSP into a
join algorithm in database.</p>
<p>When I got assigned with the task in 2019, I had no idea about what's
the corresponding algorithm name in database that shares the same
architecture as AC-4: first making CSP arc-consistency and then
solving the resulting CSP. Thanks to COVID-19, everything was online in
2020. I had the opportunity to attend the only academic conference I
have ever been to so far, SIGMOD 2020, which was served online for
free. In the conference, there was a nice <a href="https://northeastern-datalab.github.io/topk-join-tutorial/slides/Anyk-Tutorial-Part2-OptimalJoins.pdf">tutorial
session</a>,
where they brought the name <strong>Yannakakis's algorithm (YA)</strong> [<a href='#yannakakis1981algorithms' id='ref-yannakakis1981algorithms-1'>Yannakakis, 1981</a>].</p>
<p>The laser-focused TTJ development started around 08/2020 after I
quitted my full-time job at Amazon. The design requirement I received
was to not only turn TreeTracker into a join algorithm but also into
an <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2021/notes/11-queryexecution1.pdf">iterator
form</a>. The
biggest claim in Miranker's head, besides the optimality guarantee
like YA, is "downwardly compatible". That is, unlike YA that requires
a <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/notes/14-optimization.pdf">query
plan</a>
to introduce a full reducer, TTJ is just like any other binary join
operator - there is no extra surgery towards the query plan; TTJ can
be treated as a physical join operator implementation and directly be
used as a drop-in replacement of any join operator. The end result of
the iterator-form TTJ was sent to
<a href="../../../../../posts/2026/Jan/03/postmortem-on-treetracker-join-simple-optimal-fast/pods2022.pdf">PODS 2022</a> in 06/2021.</p>
<!-- This idea was -->
<!-- well-reflected in our first submission,  -->
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>All the submissions and corresponding reviews linked in text are

<p>The paper is <a href="../../../../../posts/2026/Jan/03/postmortem-on-treetracker-join-simple-optimal-fast/pods2022-reviews.pdf">not
well-received</a>. People
think in general the paper is off-topic for PODS and we need to
provide experimental evidence to show that the potential overhead
exists in YA no longer exists in TTJ even though both YA and TTJ have
the same bound <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. From theory perspective, we are optimizing some
constants that are hidden in the usual RAM complexity model. One reviewer also accurately points out a big
limitation of TTJ compared to YA is that it has to work on a <a href="http://www.cs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/554/Syllabus/5-query-opt/left-deep-trees1.html">left-deep
plan</a>
<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> to have the optimality guarantee.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>To fully appreciate the difference between YA and TTJ, I would
recommend to read Example 1 in Section 1 of <a href="../../../../../posts/2026/Jan/03/postmortem-on-treetracker-join-simple-optimal-fast/sigmod2024.pdf">SIGMOD 2025
submission</a>. If you think
iterator form of TTJ hinders your understanding of the algorithm,
I would recommend to read Example 1.1 in Section 1 of <a href="../../../../../posts/2026/Jan/03/postmortem-on-treetracker-join-simple-optimal-fast/cidr2025.pdf">CIDR 2025

TTJ algorithm in push-based model (See

</div>
<p>After receving the rejection in 08/2021, there were a lot of debate on what
the next steps should be. Miranker suggested I should translate TTJ
into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a> <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> before he
was away from the research to start selling his house in Austin and
building a new house in Utah. Without a clear roadmap for the next
steps, I decided to gather a second opinion. I first spoke with <a href="https://kexinrong.github.io/">Kexin
Rong</a> who I knew when she visited
UT-Austin for a job talk in 02/2021. She suggested to address
reviewers' comments directly by providing empirical evidence of
TTJ. The second person I spoke to is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/badin/">Bailu
Ding</a>, who I
interned with at Microsoft in the summer 2022.</p>
<!-- With my first rejection at hand, Miranker and I had a long meeting in -->
<!-- which he suggested that I should translate TTJ into -->
<!-- [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) [^4]. With great -->
<!-- confusion on why we should do it instead of addressing reviewer's -->
<!-- comments, I decided to gather a -->

<p>Empirical study of TTJ is a lot harder than it looks.</p>

<!-- The research is published on arXiv with keyword "TreeTracker Join" (<a href='#hu2024treetrackerjointurningtide' id='ref-hu2024treetrackerjointurningtide-2'>Hu et al., 2024</a>). Here is a table of summary on each submission and rejection. -->
