            <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is actually MAW 3.10. I gradually realize how dense MAW is.
In the <a href="http://zhu45.org/posts/2016/Dec/26/reflection-on-integer-arithmetic-package-problem/">previous problem</a>,
I write almost 500 lines of code. For this one, the problem is not really diffcult to solve if we implement a program 
that follows the game rule exactly. However, I figure it is a good chance to dig a little deeper to learn somewhat
fully from the question.</p>
<p>Let's start to dive in.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I first describe the <em>Josephus problem</em> in general. Then, I present a closed form solution to 
solve a special case of the original problem.
Afterwards, I present a recurrence solution to solve the general problem. </p>
<h2 id="josephus-problem">Josephus problem</h2>
<p>The <em>Josephus problem</em> is the following game: <span class="math">\(N\)</span> people, numbered <span class="math">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, are
sitting in a circle. Starting at person 1, a hot potato is passed. the <span class="math">\(M\)</span>th person 
holding the hot potato is eliminated, the circle closes ranks, and the
game continues with the person who was sitting after the eliminated person picking
up the hot potato. The last remaining person wins. Thus, if <span class="math">\(M = 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N = 5\)</span>, players
are eliminated in order, and player 5 wins. If <span class="math">\(M = 2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N = 5\)</span>, the order of elimination
is <span class="math">\(2\)</span>,<span class="math">\(4\)</span>,<span class="math">\(1\)</span>,<span class="math">\(5\)</span>.</p>
<p>You can play with different <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, <span class="math">\(N\)</span> on this <a href="http://webspace.ship.edu/deensley/mathdl/Joseph.html">site</a> to get a better sense of the problem.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>MAW uses a problem description that is slight different than the problem description usually find online. In the book, he defines <span class="math">\(M\)</span> in term of number of passes. However, in our problem description, we use <span class="math">\(M\)</span> to indicate the <span class="math">\(M\)</span>th person get
eliminated. Here is an example to show the difference.In MAW description, <span class="math">\(M = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N = 5\)</span>, players are eliminated in 
order. However, in our own intepretation, <span class="math">\(M\)</span> should be <span class="math">\(1\)</span> in order to achieve the same elimination order. Similarly, in 
the book, <span class="math">\(M = 1\)</span> when we have <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(5\)</span> elimination order for the second example.  Mathematically, 
<span class="math">\(M_{new} = M_{MAW} + 1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="josephus-problem-with-m-2">Josephus problem with <span class="math">\(M = 2\)</span></h2>
<p>Let's first discuss a special case of the Josephus Problem: <span class="math">\(M = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the following, <span class="math">\(n\)</span> denotes the number of 
people in the initial circle, and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> denotes the count for each step. In other words, <span class="math">\(m-1\)</span> people
are skipped and the <span class="math">\(m\)</span>-th is eliminated. The people in the circle are numbered from <span class="math">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Our goal
is to find <span class="math">\(J(n,m)\)</span>, which denotes the survivor's number (i.e. <span class="math">\(J(5,1) = 3\)</span>). For simplicity, let <span class="math">\(F(n) = J(n,2)\)</span>.</p>
<p><img alt="joseph problem" class="img-responsive" src="../../../../../images/josephus-1.png"/> </p>
<p>One quick observation is that after the first go-round, we are left with the same problem but for a different
number of people. For instance, when <span class="math">\(n = 10\)</span>, after the first go-round, we eliminate <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, <span class="math">\(6\)</span>, <span class="math">\(8\)</span>, <span class="math">\(10\)</span>
and then we go to the second-round beginning with <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, which is the same problem as the original one. 
The only difference is that the person with number <span class="math">\(3\)</span> in the first-round now becomes number <span class="math">\(2\)</span> in the second-round.</p>
<p><em>Case 1: When <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is even ...</em></p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(n = 2k\)</span>. After the first-round we are left with <span class="math">\(k\)</span> people, and we try to find out what is <span class="math">\(F(k)\)</span>. In addition, by
our observation, the numbering of people is changed. If <span class="math">\(3\)</span> is actually the answer (i.e. <span class="math">\(F(2k) = 3\)</span>), then in the second-round
the original person with <span class="math">\(3\)</span> now becomes <span class="math">\(2\)</span> (i.e. <span class="math">\(F(k) = 2\)</span>). So, we have</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{equation}
F(2k) = 2F(k) - 1, \text{ for } k &gt;= 1 \label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
$$</div>
<p><em>Case 2: When <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is odd ...</em></p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(n = 2k+1\)</span>. By the same reasoning as case 1, after the first-round, we still eliminate <span class="math">\(k\)</span> people. For instance, when <span class="math">\(n = 9\)</span>,
after the first-round, we elminate <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, <span class="math">\(6\)</span>, <span class="math">\(8\)</span>, <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. In other words, <span class="math">\(1\)</span> is eliminate just after person number <span class="math">\(2k\)</span>. So, we 
have</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{equation}
F(2k+1) = 2F(k) + 1, \text{ for } k &gt;= 1\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}
$$</div>
<p>So now our goal is to solve the recurrence equations \ref{eq:1} and \ref{eq:2} given <span class="math">\(F(1) = 1\)</span> to find a closed form. Let's do
this by building a table of small values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| n    | 1 | 2   3 | 4   5   6   7 | 8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15 | 16 |
|------|---|-------|---------------|-------------------------------------|----|
| F(n) | 1 | 1   3 | 1   3   5   7 | 1   3   5    7    9    11   13   15 | 1  |
</pre></div>
<p>We can group the columns by powers of <span class="math">\(2\)</span> (marked by vertical lines in the table); Inside each group,
<span class="math">\(F(n)\)</span> is always <span class="math">\(1\)</span> at the beginning and then it increases by <span class="math">\(2\)</span> until the next group, which is 
the next power of <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. So, for every number <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, there exists an integer <span class="math">\(a\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(2^a &lt;= n &lt; 2^{a+1}\)</span>.
For some <span class="math">\(0 &lt;= l &lt;= 2^a\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(n = 2^a + l\)</span>. In other words, <span class="math">\(2^a\)</span> is the largest power of 2 not exceeding <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(l\)</span> is what's left. Then, from the table above, we may have the formula:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{equation}
F(n) = F(2^a + l) = 2l + 1 \label{eq:3}
\end{equation}
$$</div>
<p>Now, let's prove equation \ref{eq:3} by induction on <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Base case.</em> When <span class="math">\(a = 0\)</span>, we must have <span class="math">\(l = 1\)</span>; thus we have <span class="math">\(F(1) = 1\)</span>, which is true.</li>
<li>
<p><em>Induction.</em> We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction#Complete_induction">strong induction</a> by
assuming that the equation holds for all <span class="math">\(a\)</span> up to certain value. Let's consider this value of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. The induction 
steps has two parts, depending on whether <span class="math">\(n\)</span> (and thus <span class="math">\(l\)</span>) is even or odd.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <span class="math">\(2^a + l = 2k\)</span>, then</p>
<p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{align*}
F(2^a + l) &amp;= 2F(2^{a-1} + l/2) - 1 &amp;&amp;\text{(by equation 1)} \\
        &amp;= 2(2l/2 + 1) - 1      &amp;&amp;\text{(by induction hypothesis)} \\
        &amp;= 2l + 1
\end{align*}
$$</div>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="math">\(2^a + l = 2k+1\)</span>, then</p>
<p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{align*}
F(2^a + l) &amp;= 2F(2^{a-1} + (l-1)/2) + 1 &amp;&amp;\text{(by equation 2)} \\
        &amp;= 2(2(l-1)/2 + 1) + 1      &amp;&amp;\text{(by induction hypothesis)} \\
        &amp;= 2l + 1
\end{align*}
$$</div>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This completes induction step.</p>
<p>Let's revisit our closed form solution \ref{eq:3} again. Let's rewrite it into the form:</p>
<div class="math">$$F(n) = 2 (n - 2^a) + 1$$</div>
<p><span class="math">\(n - 2^a\)</span> is the same as zeroing the most significant bit of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Then, we multiply the result
with <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, which is the same as shifting left one place, and adding <span class="math">\(1\)</span> is the same as setting the lowest
bit to <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. In other words, equation \ref{eq:3} is essentially do a one-bit cyclic shift left. Let's try to write this 
out formally. Let <span class="math">\(n = (b_ab_{a-1}..b_1b_0)_2\)</span>, then we have:</p>
<div class="math">$$ F(n) = F((b_ab_{a-1}..b_1b_0)_2) = (b_{a-1}...b_1b_0b_a)_2 \text{ and } b_a = 1$$</div>
<p>For a more rigorous derivation of this cyclic shift property, please reference <em>Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science</em>.</p>
<p>The way we solve Josephus problem with <span class="math">\(M = 2\)</span> is unlikely to be generalized for arbitrary <span class="math">\(m\)</span>. Let's take <span class="math">\(n = 10\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m = 2\)</span> example again. The
reason we can derive the nice recurrence equations \ref{eq:1} and \ref{eq:2} is because our observation. Let's present our
observation is a different way. <span class="math">\(F(2k)\)</span> denotes the old numbering before the first-round. <span class="math">\(F(k)\)</span> denotes the new numbering 
after the first-round.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>      m = 2               m = 3

</pre></div>
<p>By looking at the table on the left, we can easily see that <span class="math">\(F(2k) = 2F(k) - 1\)</span>. 
However, there is no nice clean linear relation that we can get between <span class="math">\(F(2k)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F(k)\)</span> 
when <span class="math">\(n = 10\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m = 3\)</span>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note<p>Inside <em>Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science</em>, after talking about the
solution to the Josephus problem, the author shift their focus to solve a generalized
recurrence of \ref{eq:1} and \ref{eq:2}, which is (1.11) in the book. This has nothing to do
with the Josephus problem and I'm guessing the reason why the author want to talk about 
the solution to the generalized recurrence is to illustrate dynamic programming philosophy.</p>
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="general-solution">General solution</h2>
<p>The big picture here is we need to find out the relative position of the final survivor to the
"first" person during each recursive call and then calculate the actual position for actual <span class="math">\(n\)</span></p>
<p>The general solution utilitizes the dynamic programming paradigm by performing the first step
and using the solution of the subproblem we create to solve the initial problem. 
In terms of the solution, there is a difference when we start with the first person as <span class="math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="starting-from-1">Starting from 1</h3>
<p>The key insight is the following: the result of <span class="math">\(J(n,m)\)</span> is best NOT thought of as the <em>number</em> that is the 
Josephus survivor, but rather as the <em>index</em> of the number that is the Josephus survivor. </p>
<p>Let's first take a look an example when <span class="math">\(n = 6\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m = 2\)</span>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>fig.1

  5 4      5 4      5 X      5 X      5 X      5 X

fig.2

| index | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| n = 6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | J(6,2) = 5
| n = 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 1 | 3 | J(5,2) = 3
| n = 4 | 5 | 6 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 6 | J(4,2) = 1
| n = 3 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 5 | J(3,2) = 3
| n = 2 | 5 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 5 | 1 | J(2,2) = 1
| n = 1 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | J(1,2) = 1

fig.3

| index | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| n = 6 | 1 | X | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | J(6,2) = 5 = (2-1 + 3) mod 6 + 1
| n = 5 | 3 | X | 5 | 6 | 1 | 3 | J(5,2) = 3 = (2-1 + 1) mod 5 + 1
| n = 4 | 5 | X | 1 | 3 | 5 | X | J(4,2) = 1 = (2-1 + 3) mod 4 + 1
| n = 3 | 1 | X | 5 | 1 | X | 5 | J(3,2) = 3 = (2-1 + 1) mod 3 + 1
| n = 2 | 5 | X | 5 | X | 5 | X | J(2,2) = 1 = (2-1 + 1) mod 2 + 1
| n = 1 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | J(1,2) = 1
</pre></div>
<p>By looking at fig.1, we know that <span class="math">\(J(6,2) = 5\)</span>. Now, if we take a look at fig.2, the row with <span class="math">\(n = 5% shows that $J(5,2) = 3\)</span>. By the insight,
<span class="math">\(3\)</span> here means the <em>index</em> not the <em>number</em>. So, our final survivor is <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, which is positioned on <span class="math">\(3\)</span> in this row.</p>
<p>Let's generalize the example a little bit. Suppose we want to know <span class="math">\(J(n,2)\)</span>. You can imagine 
we have <span class="math">\(n\)</span> people lined up like this: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1 2 3 4 5 ... n
</pre></div>
<p>The first thing that happens is that person <span class="math">\(2\)</span> get eliminated, as shown here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1 X 3 4 5 ... n
</pre></div>
<p>Now, we are left with a subproblem of the following form: there are <span class="math">\(n - 1\)</span> people remaining, every other
person is going to be eliminated, and the first person who will start to pass potato is person <span class="math">\(3\)</span>. In other 
words, the subproblem <span class="math">\(J(n-1, 2)\)</span> now looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>3 4 5 ... n 1
</pre></div>
<p><span class="math">\(J(n-1, 2)\)</span> will be the <em>index</em> of who survives in a line of <span class="math">\(n - 1\)</span> of people. Given that we have the <em>index</em>
of the person who will survive, and we also know who the starting person is, we can determine which person 
will be left. Here's how we'll do it.</p>
<p>The starting person in this line is the person who comes right after the person who was last executed. This will 
be person <span class="math">\(3\)</span>. The 1-indexed position in the ring of <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> people is given by <span class="math">\(J(n-1, 2)\)</span>. We can then walk 
forward <span class="math">\(J(n-1, 2)\)</span> positions, wrapping around the ring if necessary, to get our final position. In other words, the 
survivor is given by position</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{equation}
(3 + J(n-1, 2) - 1) \bmod n \label{eq:4}
\end{equation}
$$</div>
<p>Let's take a look at <span class="math">\(n = 5\)</span> in fig.2 again. Now, the starting position is <span class="math">\(3\)</span> and we walk forward by <span class="math">\(J(5,2) - 1\)</span> steps (i.e. <span class="math">\(2\)</span> steps) 
and we get the final survivor, which is <span class="math">\(5\)</span>. The reason we doing <span class="math">\(\bmod n\)</span> is because we want to keep final survivor within the bounds of the circle.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem with our equation \ref{eq:4}. If we are indeed using one-indexing, what happens if the final survivor is at position <span class="math">\(n\)</span>?
In that case, we would accidentally get back position <span class="math">\(0\)</span> as our answer, but we really want position <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. For example, suppose <span class="math">\(J(5,2) = 4\)</span>. In other words,
the final survivor is <span class="math">\(6\)</span>, which is positioned at <span class="math">\(4\)</span> when <span class="math">\(n = 5\)</span>. Then, to apply equation \ref{eq:4}, we get <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, which is not <span class="math">\(6\)</span>.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, we'll use a trick for using mod to wrap around with one-indexing: we'll take the inside quantity (the one-indexed position) and 
subtract one to get the zero-indexed position. We'll mod that quantity by <span class="math">\(n\)</span> to get the zero-indexed position wrapped around. Finally, we'll add 
back one to get the one-indexed position, wrapped around. That looks like:</p>
<div class="math">$$(3 + J(n-1, 2) - 2) \bmod n + 1$$</div>
<p>In other words, <span class="math">\(-2\)</span> term comes from two independent <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>'s: the first <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> is because <span class="math">\(J(n-1, 2)\)</span> returns a one-indexed index, so to step forward by
the right number of positions we have to take <span class="math">\(J(n-1,2) - 1\)</span> steps forward. The second <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> comes from the fact that we're using one-indexing rather than
zero-indexing.</p>
<p>Now, we're finally ready to generalize the solution to arbitrary <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, not just <span class="math">\(m = 2\)</span>. After person <span class="math">\(m\)</span> get eliminated, we have an array like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1 2 3 ... m-1 X m+1 ... n
</pre></div>
<p>We now essentailly need to solve a subproblem where person <span class="math">\(m+1\)</span> comes first:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>m+1 m+2 ... n 1 2 ... m-1
</pre></div>
<p>So we compute <span class="math">\(J(n-1, m)\)</span> to get the one-indexed survivor of a ring of <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> people, then shift forward by that many steps:</p>
<div class="math">$$(m+1 + J(n-1, m) - 1)$$</div>
<p>We need to worry about the case where we wrap around, so we need to mod by <span class="math">\(n\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">$$(m+1 + J(n-1, m) - 1) \bmod n$$</div>
<p>However, we're one-indexed, so we need to use the trick of subtracing <span class="math">\(1\)</span> from the inside quantity and then adding <span class="math">\(1\)</span> at the end:</p>
<div class="math">$$(m+1 + J(n-1, m) - 2) \bmod n + 1$$</div>
<p>which simplifies to:</p>
<div class="math">$$(m-1 + J(n-1, m)) \bmod n + 1$$</div>
<p>Notice that <span class="math">\(J(1,m) = 1\)</span>, which indicates that we're one-indexed.</p>
<h3 id="starting-from-0">Starting from 0</h3>
<p>Since we are not in zero-indexed. Our <span class="math">\(J(6,2)\)</span> example looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| n = 6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | J(6,2) = 4 = (2 + 2 ) mod 6
| n = 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 1 | 3 | J(5,2) = 2 = (0 + 2 ) mod 5
| n = 4 | 5 | 6 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 6 | J(4,2) = 0 = (2 + 2 ) mod 4
| n = 3 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 5 | J(3,2) = 2 = (0 + 2 ) mod 3
| n = 2 | 5 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 5 | 1 | J(2,2) = 0 = (0 + 2 ) mod 2 
| n = 1 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | J(1,2) = 0
</pre></div>
<p>Let's apply the same logic from the one-indexed case. After person <span class="math">\(m-1\)</span> get eliminated, we have an array like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0 1 2 ... m-2 X m ... n-1
</pre></div>
<p>We now essentailly need to solve a subproblem where person <span class="math">\(m\)</span> comes first:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>m m+1 ... n-1 0 1 2 ... m-2
</pre></div>
<p>So, we compute <span class="math">\(J(n-1,m)\)</span> to give us the zero-indexed survivor of a ring of <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> people and we shfit forward by that many steps:</p>
<div class="math">$$(m + J(n-1,m))$$</div>
<p>We take care of wrapping around by mod <span class="math">\(n\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">$$(m + J(n-1,m)) \bmod n$$</div>
<p>Since we are zero-indexed, we are done. If we want to transform our answer to one-indexed, we can do:</p>
<div class="math">$$(m + J(n-1,m) \bmod n + 1$$</div>
<p>Note that <span class="math">\(J(1,m) = 0\)</span> in this case, which indicates that we're zero-indexed.</p>
