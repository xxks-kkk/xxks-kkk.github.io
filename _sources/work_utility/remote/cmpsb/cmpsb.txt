        cmpsb -- Compare SB

        Disclaimer:
	        This tool is well-tested on hotellnx machines in Toronto Lab, and its functionality
	        relies heavily on IBM ClearCase product. Please use on your own risk.

        Feature:
	        1. with "-d" option, it lists the files with code change in the given SB. In addition,
	        it generates diff file for each file, which can be further utilized with "patch" software.
	        For additional info about "patch", see here:
	        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)
                
                2. with "-s" option, it checks if the current view contains code change in the given SB.
                Example:
                current view is on SB 34763, and we can use this tool to check if current view 
	        contains code change in SB 34380.

	        If SB 34763 indeed doesn NOT contain contain code change in "foo.C" in SB 34380, then
	        the tool will generated following two diff files for "foo.C":

                1) diff: SB 34380 foo.C/1  vs  SB 34380 foo.C/0   
                        (1 represents current "foo.C" in SB 34380, 0 represents its previous checkin in SB 34380)
                2) diff: SB 34380 foo.C/1  vs  SB 34763 foo.C/1
                        (1 represents current "foo.C" in SB 34380, SB 34763 respectively)
  	        
                3. Additional tutorial on this tool, see doc "check_whether_a_SB_contains_previous_SB_fix_code.doc"
	        4. "mkbldtree", "selview" are required and this tool will not check for this.

        Convention:
	        [] Parameters shown inside brackets are required and must be provided.
	        <> Parameters shown inside angle brackets are optional and do not have to be provided.
	        |  Vertical bars indicate that one (and only one) item in the list of items presented can be specified	
                 
        Syntax:
	        ./cmpsb <-h | --help> [ <-d | --diff> <-s | --san> ] [SB number]
        -d      (or --diff) let tool do code change check for the given SB (indicated by SB number)
        -s      (or --san ) let tool do check to see if current view contains code change in the given SB 
                (indicated by SB number)
        -h      (or --help) display this help guide
