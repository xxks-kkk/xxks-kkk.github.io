I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in `computer science`__,
`economics`__, and `mathematics`__ at `University of Wisconsin-Madison`__.

I am interested in Economics (i.e., `econometrics`__, `game theory`__), and programming(i.e., Python_).

Currently, as an undegraduate student, I am working towards it by taking various courses in different fields that could fullfil my interest.
