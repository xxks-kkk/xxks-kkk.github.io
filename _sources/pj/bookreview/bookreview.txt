Computer Science Library

As insipired by `game design library <http://www.lizengland.com/blog/game-design-library/>`_ and `gatesnotes <https://www.gatesnotes.com/>`_, I decide
to build my own book library and develop study notes along with some critics. 
The library is majorly involved with computer science but not restricted to that solely.
