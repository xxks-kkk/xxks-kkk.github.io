Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) 2013
#############################################

This is my first time in my life to participate this exciting competition. 
I am so lucky to have a chance to work with my two unbelievably amazing teammates - Nick Grabon, and Sunil Upadhyay --
two great "physicists".

From them, I learned a lot of things: *Nick*, who shows me how to critically construct the model; 
*Sunil*, who makes everything well-organized. Thank you,all!

   **PROBLEM B: Water, Water, Everywhere**

   Fresh water is the limiting constraint for development in much of the world. 
   Build a mathematical model for determining an effective, feasible, and cost-efficient water strategy for 2013 to meet the projected water needs of 
   [pick one country from the list below] in 2025, and identify the best water strategy. 
   In particular, your mathematical model must address storage and movement; de-salinization; and conservation.
   If possible, use your model to discuss the economic, physical, and environmental implications of your strategy.
   Provide a non-technical position paper to governmental leadership outlining your approach, its feasibility and costs,
   and why it is the “best water strategy choice.”

   Countries: United States, China, Russia, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia

During this contest, I am mainly in charge of the model implementation and simulation interpretation, including data visualization, and 
data interpretation.
