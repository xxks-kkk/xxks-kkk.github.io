Project Oveview
************************

LemonDB is a single-user RDBMS for database starters (like me). The name of this project, *LemonDB*, inspires from a `classic economic problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons>`_  that I learned when I was an undergraduate. Lemon means something bad after using it in slang. So is this project.
There really no checkpoint saying that "Once you did this, you are good with database." There is so much for me to learn about RDBMS, which means this project
will never have GA and it will always be under development. 

**Goals:**

The goal of this project is the following:

- Have fun while keeping myself busy in my spare time
- Spirit successor of Minirel RDBMS developed as an educational database framework in UW-Madison (it is being replaced by `BadgerDB <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/cs564/>`_ but I want to do mine.)
- Push me to learn
- Open sourced `Minibase <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dbbook/openAccess/Minibase/minibase.html>`_. Minibase is availabe only for instructor, which prevents me
  from getting it. So, I decide to do one on my own with specifications from Minibase.

What have I learned from LemonDB

**Background**

2016-04-15

I got a B in the only DBMS course I have taken so far, which is CS564 by `Professor Jeff Naughton <https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~naughton/>`_ in Fall 2014.
Then, in August 2015, I got a job at IBM to work on federation that ships with many IBM analytics products (DB2, dashDB ...).
