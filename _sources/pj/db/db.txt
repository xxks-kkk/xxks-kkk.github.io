Project Oveview
************************

LemonDB is a single-user RDBMS for database starters (like me). The name of this project, *LemonDB*, inspires from a `classic economic problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons>`_  that I learned when I was an undergraduate. Lemon means something bad after using it in slang. So is this project.
There really no checkpoint saying that "Once you did this, you are good with database." There is so much for me to learn about RDBMS, which means this project
will never have GA and it will always be under development. 

The goal of this project is the following:

- Have fun while keeping myself busy in my spare time
- Spirit successor of Minirel RDBMS developed as an educational database framework in UW-Madison with more features
- Push me to learn

This project is being developed loosely in :ref:`agile fasion <timetable.rst>`
