About this site

Why Sphinx
-----------

Reasons that why I choose Sphinx to implement my personal website are the following:

* extremely organizable toolset that allows me to document the projects easily and efficiently.

* a great learning tool for me to transit into Django Web framework.

* Use Python to manage the whole website!


TODO List
-----------

This is a collection of features or bugs about this website that
I need to implement or fix someday in the future.

* change the project list page to make some subtitle.

* indicate the progress of each project (done or under development) at the end of each title:
  ie. Myproject (*done*) or Myproject2 (*under development*)

* customize the pygments code highlighting color.
  
  This is one `coloring example <http://www.dellsystem.me/posts/pi-code/>`_ 
  I really like

* add the exception highlighting into ipython_highlighting extension.

* :strike:`customize more about navbar to make it more "fashion"`

* add python gallery like `matplotlib`_, present all the graph I have done so far via python.

* build *IDLE* style for pygments

* :strike:`fix the weird display of the heading "regular expression" in
  projects > study notes > dive into python study notes > general python
  programming > regular expression`

* :strike:`figure out how to add metadata (i.e. keywords, author, description) into
  the HTML pages.`
