"The Master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work 
and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his 
education and his recreation, his love and his religion. 
He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence
in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing.
To him he is always doing both."

"I've always lived cheaply. I live like a
student, basically.  And I like that, because it means that money is not
telling me what to do.  I can do what I think is important for me to do.
It freed me to do what seemed worth doing.  So make a real effort to
avoid getting sucked into all the expensive lifestyle habits of typical
Americans.  Because if you do that, then people with the money will
dictate what you do with your life.  You won't be able to do what's really
important to you."

2 years programming and learning algorithms."

**-- Erik Demaine**

"To use an analogy, if algorithms were about automobiles, it would be for the person
who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient,
safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. The people who hate algorithms are the ones
who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else."

**-- Peter Norvig**

"I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate. 
The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting 
although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated."

not sleeping and exercising enough. That frees up several hours a day. 
The only downside is that you get fat and die."

**-- Scott Adams**

"Good judgment comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgment. 
If things aren't going well it probably means you are learning a lot
