========================
Project Euler Solutions 
========================

`Project Euler`__ is a fun place where you could find tons of interesting mathematical/computer programming problems.

In the past, I spent some time on this to brush up my programming skills (i.e. practice for a new language) or just to have some fun. 

The following are solutions I came up when I tried to solve those problems. 
They may not be the most efficient solutions. Please contact me if you want to share your ideas with me. I will be very happy :)

.. warning::
    
   Please try yourself first. You *will* lose much fun if you directly stare at the solutions.

        - read through the problems 1 - 10, and summarize the useful math knowledge
        - based upon that knowledge, develop a python module that includes the most frequently used functions in this project so far (i.e., 
          test for prime) and include API about each function, and explain the algorithm behind it.
