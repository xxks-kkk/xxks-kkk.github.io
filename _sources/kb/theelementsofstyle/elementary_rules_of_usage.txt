Elementary Rules of Usage
=========================

1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding ``'s``
---------------------------------------------------------

- Follow this rule whatever the final consonant

  .. admonition:: Examples

     * Charles's friend
     * Burns's poems
     * the witch's malice

  .. admonition:: Exceptions
    
     Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names in *-es* and *-is*

     * Jesus'
     * for conscience' sake
     * for righteousness' sake

- The pronominal possessives *hers*, *its*, *theirs*, *yours*, and *ours* have no apostrophe.

- Indefinite pronouns use the apostrophe to show possession

  .. admonition:: Examples

     * one's rights
     * somebody else's umbrella

2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Examples

   * red, white, and blue
   * gold, silver, or copper
   * He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents

- In the names of business firms the last comma is usually omitted. Follow the usage of the individual firm.

  .. admonition:: Examples

     * Brown, Shipley and Co.
     * Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated

3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas
-------------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Examples
  
   * The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.

- Never omit one comma and leave the other

  .. admonition: Non-Examples

     * Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday.
     * My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health.

- decide whether a single word or a brief phase is or is not parenthetic

  * If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight, the writer may safely omit the commas.
  * Dates usually contain parenthetic words or figures.

    .. admonition:: Examples

       * February to July, 1972
       * April 6, 1956
       * Wednesday, November 13, 1929
       * ``6 April 1958``

  * A name or a title in direct address is parenthetic

    .. admonition:: Examples

       * If, Sir, you refuse, I cannot predict what will happen.
       * Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in.

  * The abbreviations ``etc.``, ``i.e.``, and ``e.g.``, the abbreviations for academic degress, and titles that follow a name are parenthetic

    .. admonition:: Examples
     
       * Letters, packages, etc., should go here.
       * Horace Fulsome, Ph.D., presided.
       * Rachel Simmonds, Attorney
       * The Reverend Harry Lang, S.J.

  * No comma, however, should separate a noun from a restrictive term of identification.

    .. admonition:: Examples

       * Billy the Kid
       * The novelist John Fowles
       * William the Conqueror
       * Pliny the Younger

  * *Junior*, with its abbreviation *Jr.* is not in need of a comma

    .. admonition:: Examples
      
       * James Wright Jr.

  * Nonrestrictive relative claues are parenthetic, as are similar clauses introduced by conjuntions indicating time or place. Commas are therefore needed.

    .. admonition:: Nonrestrictive clause

       is one that does not serve to identify or define the antecedent noun.

    .. admonition:: Examples
      
       * The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and more interested.
       * In 1769, when Napoleon was born, Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.
       * Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner*, is a few miles from Bridgewater.

       In these sentences, the clauses introduced by *which*, *when*, and *where* are nonrestrictive, they do not limit or define,
       they merely add something:

            In the first example, the clause introduced by *which* does not serve to tell which of several possible audiences is meant; 
            the reader presumably knows that already. The clause adds, parenthetically, a statement supplementing that in the main clause.

       Each of the three sentences is a combination of two statements that might have been made independently:

            * The audience was at first indifferent. Later it became more and more interested.
            * Napoleon was born in 1769. At that time Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.
            * Coleridge wrote *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner* at Nether Stowey. Nether Stowey is a few miles from Bridgewater.

  * Restrictive clauses are not parenthetic and are not set off by commas.

    .. admonition:: Examples
     
       People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

       Here the clause introduced by *who* does serve to tell which people are meant; the sentence, unlike the sentences above, cannot be split
       into two independent statements.

  * The same principle of comma use applies to participial phrases and to appositives.

    .. admonition:: Examples
     
       People sitting in the rear couldn't hear. (*restrictive*)
       Uncle Bert, being slightly deaf, moved forward. (*nonrestrictive*)

       My cousin Bob is a talented harpist (*restrictive*)
       Our oldest daughter, Mary, sings. (*nonrestrictive*)

  * When the main clause of a sentence is preceded by a phrase or a subordinate clause, use a comma to set off these elements.

    .. admonition:: Examples

       Partly by hard fighting, partly by diplomatic skill, they enlarged their dominions to the east and rose to royal rank with the possession of
       Sicily.

4. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause
