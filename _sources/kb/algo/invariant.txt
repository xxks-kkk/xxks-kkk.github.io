Loop invariants

Last Update: |today|

I have hard time to understand loop invariant back to my college algorithm class. Quite often, I simply treat the following
two terms as equal: "loop conditions" & "loop invariants". However, until one day I encounter this term once again and it
looks very similar to me but I cannot recall accurately on what exactly it represents. Even worse, the algorithm class 
memory flash back again. So, I decide to spend some time to pause from work and nail this concept. So, here we go.
