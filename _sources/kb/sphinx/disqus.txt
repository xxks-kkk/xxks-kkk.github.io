Add disqus into doc

One of the driven factors that I want to remake my own personal website is that one day I saw this cool `site`_. I really want to have some interaction
with unknown readers (I mean you :)) while also having some chance to keep improving based upon feedbacks (again, I mean yours :)). However,
I am reluctant to adopt the easy-out way: learn `pelican`_ --> use `fresh`_ them --> start writing. This mainly because I love Sphinx documentation style.
So clean, so elegant (BTW, even `pelican`_ use Sphinx to do their `doc`_, haha). After some experimenting, I finally make it work and I'll document it for
future reference:

Dirty Way In
*************

Once you register a website in `disqus`_, you will direct to *Installation* section. You choose *Universal Code* and will get a chunk of code that
asks you to "Place the following code where you'd like Disqus to load"::

    <div id="disqus_thread"></div>
         <script>
             /**
              * RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT AND UNCOMMENT THE SECTION BELOW TO INSERT DYNAMIC VALUES FROM YOUR PLATFORM OR CMS.
              * LEARN WHY DEFINING THESE VARIABLES IS IMPORTANT: https://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/#configuration-variables
              */
              /*
               var disqus_config = function () {
               this.page.url = PAGE_URL; // Replace PAGE_URL with your page's canonical URL variable
               this.page.identifier = PAGE_IDENTIFIER; // Replace PAGE_IDENTIFIER with your page's unique identifier variable
               };
               */
               var disqus_shortname = 'zeyuan'; // required: replace example with your forum shortname 
               (function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
               var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
               s.src = '//zeyuan.disqus.com/embed.js';
               s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
               (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
               })();
         </script>
