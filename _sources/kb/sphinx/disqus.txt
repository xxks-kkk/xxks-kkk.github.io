One of the driven factors that I want to remake my own personal website is that one day I saw this cool `site`_. I really want to have some interaction
with unknown readers (I mean you :)) while also having some chance to keep improving based upon feedbacks (again, I mean yours :)). However,
I am reluctant to adopt the easy-out way: learn `pelican`_ --> use `fresh`_ them --> start writing. This mainly because I love Sphinx documentation style.
So clean, so elegant (BTW, even `pelican`_ use Sphinx to do their `doc`_, haha). After some experimenting, I finally make it work and I'll document it for
future reference:
