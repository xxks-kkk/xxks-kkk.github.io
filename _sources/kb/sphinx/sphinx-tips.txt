Collection of tips when working with `Sphinx-Doc`_. 


- filename provided to a directive is usually relative to the directory the current source file is contained in, but if it absolute (starting with
  :command:`\`), it is taken as relative to the top source directory.

.. topic:: Example

	   ``.. include:: links.rst`` expect a doc ``links.rst`` in the same directory as the current source file. However, ``.. include:: /links.rst``
	   assumes ``links.rst`` in top source directory, which is :command:`source/`

.. include:: /links.rst
