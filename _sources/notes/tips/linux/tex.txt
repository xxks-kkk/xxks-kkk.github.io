Run tlmgr 
***********

1. setting PATH: ``PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH``
2. runing tlmgr: ``sudo env PATH="$PATH" tlmgr``

.. note::

        Basically, ``sudo`` resets the value of ``$PATH`` (the whole environment, indeed) to
        a "known good" one, and is thus ignoring any changes you made to your local environment.
        The ``env`` command above sets the ``$PATH`` variable in the environment of ``tlmgr`` it
        executes, so it runs with the value of ``$PATH`` you specify on the command line.

3. ``pygmentize -L Lexers`` helpful to identify what supported language are in Pygment. Especially useful
   when you want to do source code highlight using "minted" package in LaTex
