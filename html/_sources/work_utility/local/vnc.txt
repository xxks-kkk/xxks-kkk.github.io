        1. ``vncserver -list``
        2. ``kill pid``
        3. ``vncserver :1`` (``:1`` is port number you specified when you using VNC Viewer)
        4. Using VNC Viewer to connect

- Show vnc viewer menu:

.. code-block:: shell

        "F8"

- To change the vnc viewer screen resolution:

.. code-block:: shell

        # displays all the avaliable screen resolutions:
        xrandr
        # switch to desired resolution
        xrandr -s 1360x768
